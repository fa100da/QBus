## QBUS
Creating a robust bus timings database involves integrating real-time GPS and traffic data to account for potential delays. This solution aims to minimize the dynamic nature of bus schedules by leveraging historical information, providing commuters with more accurate Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). The goal is to enhance transportation efficiency and improve the overall user experience.

- the app contains 2 user sides -one for bus drivers and passengers.
- The driver can update his live location.
- Users can see the live location of the bus through the bus driver's phone's live location
- additional ticketing system.
-  NOTE: the app is in the very early stage, and was made as a prototype for a hackathon.

E-Ticket features

- Name of passenger
- Date and Time of generation
- Name of the bus user booked for
- A unique code generated for that ticket
- A live timer that counts down the time to ticket expiry. Ticket expires after an estimated total of waiting time and trip time. Screenshots are disabled but the timer will make them useless even if the user bypasses the blockers.
- A unique QR code that the bus conductor or driver can check for legitimacy of ticket of necessary,
- An expired banner across the ticket so the ticket can be checked without being easy to reuse
